## Brief history
Born and raised in GÃ¶teborg, Sweden. I wrote my first website in 1994.
With my MSc in AI and BSc in computer engineering I found myself sitting in
Antwerpen, Belgium, "coding" for a great big Multinational Company, I was horrible at it.
Finding no joy I was extreamly lucky to eventually find a new Job doing Ruby on Rails development for a
start-up in Brussels. When in 2011 I moved with my wife to her home country of Latvia, I founded my
own web shop consultancy thing, doing mainly ruby, called [http://minigrand.com](mini|GRAND).

##This blog
This blog, has very few posts on it, this is due mostly to my own insecurites about putting stuff out there
and being judged by other ppl. I'm actively working on getting better at this but don't hold your breath for
a ton of content. But then again, who knows.
